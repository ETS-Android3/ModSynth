# ModSynth

A modular synthesizer for Android.  See https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gallantrealm.modsynth for the installable.  If you'd like to view or create an issue for a problem or new feature see the list at https://github.com/owingsbj/ModSynth/issues.

This synthesizer is based on the MySynth synthesizer engine.   At this time, portions of ModSynth are being generalized and moved to MySynth.  Once that completes,
MySynth will be made public and you can use it to build your own synthesizer for Android.
